Inserting a link to a web page is, of course, easy in Mac OS X Mail: you just paste the address from your browser's address bar. But when the way Mac OS X Mail formats outgoing mail conflicts with the way the recipient's email client reads it (that can happen), your link may arrive in non-clickable form.

Or maybe you are using rich text formatting when composing messages anyway, so links should look like they do on web sites as well. In either case, turning text into a clickable link in your emails may not be obvious in Mail, but it is easy.
