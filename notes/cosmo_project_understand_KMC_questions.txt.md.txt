questions to Bill/Michele:
    - barrier hight also for other elements? (given in Mantina2009 paper)
    - whole KMC IS VACANCY DIFFUSION GOVERNED (pge 36 danieles thesis, ref 20). How important are the other processes?
    - according to danieles thesis the prefactor can vayr over 7 orders of magnitude (siehe page 35). Ref. 131 132


possible extensions:
    - the barrier hight could be computed from NEB in every step.
    - the prefactor can be assessed from harmonic matrix at current position and harmonic matrix of next position (in ipi this can in principle be done by using more cores and calculating hessemat at every step)
