zcat  -->  zgrep ".*"   zcat does not work properly on all systems (expects .Z extension sometimes)

sh    -->  bash         sh is typically mapped on some other shell which might not be compatible
                        bash enforces using the correct shell (if available)

sed -r  -->  sed -E     sed -r does not work on MacOs; sed -E seems to work generally

sed -i  -->             sed -i on MacOs does not work as on unix;
        --> lom=`getlinuxormac`;[ "$lom" = "Linux" ] && add="";[ "$lom" = "mac" ] && add="'' -e"
        --> sed -i $add     instead of sed -i  works on both


wc -w   -->  awk '{print NF}'   wc -w left aligns in GNU but right aligns in BSD
or
wc -w --> wc -w | sed 's|[ ]*||g'   --> wc -w and wc -l prints not leftaligned in mac os X
                                    --> try sed -i "s|wc -\([wlc]\)|wc -\1 \| sed 's\|[ ]\*\|\|g'|g" file

source -->              keep in mind that "source filename" will not work if you dont have . in your PATH set
                        if you use bash than "source filename" will work
