 HSQDTM=3.81       eV Ang^2        hbar^2/2*m_e  (this constant is slightly wrong in constant.inc: it is 3.81001987408079 but should be 3.80998174766464492;
                                                this is due to an error in the RYTOEV constant which is 13.605826 but which should be 13.6056919)
