1.) Ctrl+U and Ctrl+Y.

Do you know that moment when you’re typing a long command, and then suddenly realize you need to execute something else first? Especially when working over an SSH connection, when you can’t easily open a second terminal on the same machine, this can be very annoying. Solution: ensure your cursor is at the end of your current command (shortcut: Ctrl+E), press Ctrl+U to get a clean line, type the other command you need to execute first, execute it, then press Ctrl+Y and voila! Your long command is back on the line. No mouse needed for copying, just quick hotkeys.
