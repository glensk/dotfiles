to insert formulas: do it with the keybord (press enter) to get the item you want


I don't have any duplicate font files, so I skipped this. I ran Disk Utility and repaired permissions but this didn't solve the problem. However I found something very
interesting. Right after the equation editor window appears, if I click on a menu item like one would normally do, a second equation editor window appears right under the
first one. Now, if I close that second window, everything becomes normal and I can compose equations. I do believe that there is a bug here. 
--> THis is although the case for me
